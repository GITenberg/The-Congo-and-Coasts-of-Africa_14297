description: Davis chronicles his adventures and those of his wife, Cecil Clark Davis,
  as they traveled along the coasts of Africa in 1907. Their interactions with the
  nature, people, and animals of the land are interesting and precarious. This is
  a detailed catalogue of his experiences, written with Davis's usual flair for excitement,
  drama, and attention to detail.
